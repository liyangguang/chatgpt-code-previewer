# ChatGPT Code Previewer

A simple extension to render HTML (with CSS and JS), SVG, and Markdown code generated by ChatGPT directly on the page.

## Run locally

### Landing page

This is a basic Vue app under `/src` folder, using Vite.

1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`

### Extension

No compile tooling. Simply js files under `/extension`. It can be loaded manually on `chrome://extensions`.

### Deployment

1. Update version number on `/extension/manifest.json` and `package.json` (just to be consistent)
1. Run `package-extension.js` to compile

## TODOs

- Add a script to update the version number in all places.
- Consider adding non html support?
- Consider change the extension code to TS?
